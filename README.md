2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Running the App

After starting the development server:

```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Mobile-First**: Designed for mobile constraints, enhanced for larger screens
2. **Feature-Based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, screens, and state
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for better developer experience
4. **Performance**: Using React Native's New Architecture (Fabric + TurboModules)
5. **Cross-Platform**: 90% code sharing between iOS, Android, and web

## Development Guidelines

1. **Components**: Use the design system tokens for consistent styling
2. **State**: Use Redux Toolkit for global state, local state for component-specific data
3. **Navigation**: Follow the established navigation patterns
4. **Testing**: Write unit tests for components and integration tests for features

## Next Steps

1. Implement VA profile details screen
2. Add search functionality with filters
3. Build real-time messaging with Socket.io
4. Create user profile management
5. Add payment integration (Phase 2)
6. Implement AI-powered matching algorithm
